<h3>Testing web services, with an object oriented way</h3>

<h4>Writing test scripts with SoapUI Open Source to test web services, it is common to clone steps and re-use them, having a project full of duplications and hard to maintain.
Wouldnâ€™t it be nice if there were objects to instantiate and call their methods from every step that is needed, with an easy way?
It does not have to do with the tool, but how we use it. After implementing thousands of test cases and many test project structures, it is time for our lesson learnt to take place.  
In this talk I will present you a full structure of a SoapUI Service Test Project with an Object-Oriented way. Additionally, I will show you a comparison between the implementation based on Object-Oriented programming and the implementation based on test step cloning. 
The conclusion, is yours to make.
